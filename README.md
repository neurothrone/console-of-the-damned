# Console of the Damned ☠️

Welcome, traveler.  
You have booted into a terminal that probably shouldn't exist.  
It hums, it flickers, and it definitely judges your typing speed.  

Inside lurks a tiny text-based crawler where you:  
- Pick a cursed class (sturdy, spooky, or stylish).  
- Wander the pixelated catacombs of your imagination.  
- Fight ghouls, maggots, and other workplace metaphors.  
- Rest on suspiciously cozy piles of bones.  
- Collect loot that smells faintly of regret.  

All in glorious ANSI colors that make your terminal glow like an arcane lantern.

### How to play

```bash
dotnet run --project ConsoleOfTheDamned.Terminal
```

> Pro tip: type carefully. The console is watching. 👁️
